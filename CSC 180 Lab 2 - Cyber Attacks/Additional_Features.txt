Additional Features
For the additional features, we implemented multi-classification  for the FNN and CNN models. and performed oversampling on the data particularly with worms, shellcodes and analysis attacks. With both features we found that our model would generally overfit, but this was less apparent with the oversampled data size. We think this is because the data set was originally too small for what it was. For the first additional feature, we saw that the model would predict accurately for some classes compared to others. We believe that the reason for this is because of the lack of samples for those classes. The classes with the least amount of samples are worms, shellcodes and analysis attacks. Once we oversampled the data, by increasing the count to 20,000, our model was able to predict and a better spread.
